0:00:13.2 **Adam Garrett-Harris** Hello, and welcome to BookBytes, a book club podcast for developers. We’re continuing our summer of an Imposter’s syndrome by talking about “The Imposter’s Handbook” by Rob Conery which is a CS primer for self-taught programmers. So today we’re going to go over chapters 8 and 9: Advanced Algorithms and Compilation.  I’m Adam Garrett-Harris. 

0:00:36.5 **Safia Abdalla** I’m Safia Abdalla. 

0:00:38.2 **Jen Luker** I’m Jen Luker. 

0:00:39.5 **Jason Staten** And I’m Jason Staten.
