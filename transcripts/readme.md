# Transcripts for Orbit FM

Transcripts for episodes are stored here.

The original transcripts are in `.txt` files, and they are automatically converted into `.json` with a script located at `/scripts/convertTranscript`.

## Format

The format for the transcripts is:

```
0:00:36.2 **Adam Garrett-Harris** Iâ€™m Adam Garrett-Harris.
```

### Timestamp

`0:00:36.2` is an option timestamp

### Name

`**Adam Garrett-Harris**` is an optional name

If it matches the first and last name of a known person, their picture will be shown on the page.

It can also include multiple people:

```
0:45:49.2 **Jen Luker & Safia Abdalla & Adam Garrett-Harris** (laughing)**
```

### Text

And everything else is the text.

If someone speaks in multiple paragraphs, you can put it on a new line. It can include an optional timestamp.

```
0:01:41.2 **Dave Hoover** First paragraph

Second paragraph
```

#### Markdown
